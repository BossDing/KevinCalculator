# KevinCalculator


	This is a calculator with Chinese voice enabled which I implemented 1 year ago .
It also has a beautiful UI.And better history list with swap to dismiss function. 
Also ,with functions to add all the results user calculated. 
Please feel free to give some advice. **This project is not well tested **.
